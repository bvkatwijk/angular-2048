# Angular2048

Attempted a clone of the [2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) game to learn Angular 2. Used [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) so there are a couple of test examples in there. Abandoned after I felt I learned enough and completing the entire game would be more tedious than educational.
